        <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,<br>
            a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.<br>
            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). <br>
            Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing,<br>
            particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. <br>
            In this handout,  we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
